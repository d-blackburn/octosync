## What is this?

OctoSync is an application designed to automate repetitive tasks in GitHub. If you're part of an organisation that contains
a lot of repositories in GitHub, you may find that maintaining consistency for things like Issue and Pull Request templates
can be quite tedious. Changes to one means changes to all - resulting in repeating the process of creating a branch,
making the changes, committing the work, making a Pull Request and finally merging the changes - for every repository.

Doing this whole process meets the literal dictionary definition of **FAFF** and was the motivation behind this application. 
Whilst it's relatively lackluster at the moment in terms of features, it's going to save myself (and hopefully you) a 
lot of time going through the above process.

## What can it do?

Whilst I'm more than happy to build on this further to reduce "high-faff" tasks, here is what it can do right now:

- **Template Syncing**: Copy all Issue and/or Pull Request templates from a source to multiple destinations repositories
- **Label Syncing**: Copy all repository labels from a source to multiple destination repositories
